# wxWidgets Example

This example is based off of the vsgQt code with modifications made specific for using wxWidgets as the GUI system.
The example currently runs on Linux and Win32 with a macOS version coming soon (when my new iMac shows up).

## Special Note

For the Win32 version to work you must be using my fork of the VSG located here https://github.com/deadcast2/VulkanSceneGraph in the meantime until native window insertion is in the master version of the VSG.
